# The Visualization Codes for paper "UNDER REVIEW"

## Quick start

Please take a look of `demo.ipynb` and walk through the codes.

The process has three steps:
    1. Load checkpoint, run environment and collect a sequence of frames.
    2. For each agent, generate the multiple-exposure figure.
    3. Concatenate the figure of different agents and add extra
        information like the reward or the agent name (not supported yet).

It should be note that this codes is organized in the very naive way and
due to the future development of our toolbox this code may not be compatible anymore 
--- That's the reason we left the codes in this branchã€‚
